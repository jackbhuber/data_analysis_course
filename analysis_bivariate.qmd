# Statistics for bivariate analyses {.unnumbered}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are two statistics for bivariate (two variable) analyses:

### Chi-square $\chi 2$ tests of association

The chi-square $\chi 2$ test is a commonly used statistic for nominal/categorical data. We use it to examine the distribution of cases across **categories**. Essentially, it compares the distribution of cases you actually see to the distribution of cases you would expect to see from normal variation.

Here is one example of a chi-square $\chi 2$ test for a recent resident project. The question is whether gender (male/female) makes a statistically significant difference in whether patients need three or more dose changes of bivalirudin before they reach a therapeutic goal.

```{r}
#d <- read.csv("data/bivalirudin.csv") # load data
#table_dosechgs_gender <- xtabs(~d$d_Male + d$DV_3DoseChanges, data=d) # crosstabulate 
#knitr::kable(table_dosechgs_gender, align = "l")
#summary(table_dosechgs_gender) # calculate chi-square
```

The chi-square $\chi 2$ value of 1.9421 with one degree of freedom has a p-value of 0.1634. It is not statistically significant, suggesting that gender makes no significant difference in reaching therapeutic goal.

### t tests

The t test is a commonly used statistic for comparing two groups on a continuous outcome.
