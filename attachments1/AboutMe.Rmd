I've gone by different titles -- sociologist, data analyst, psychometrician, assessment director -- but the common theme of my career has been an enduring commitment to use data in the service of the common good.

In college and the first part of my graduate studies I studied sociology. That's where I learned statistics and how to analyze data from large data sets (national surveys). Back then I was interested in the modeling the effects of religious attitudes and beliefs on political attitudes and behavior in American Christianity. I have an enduring fascination with religion and continue to study it [on the side](https://jackhuber.org).

In 2000, I left sociology and went to work for a K-12 school district as its first data analyst, my task being to make actionable sense of standardized test scores for principals and teachers. There I learned how to present data attractively for people who are easily confused by it. Along the way I earned my doctorate in educational psychology where I discovered the strange but fascinating world of psychometrics and dove deep into the study of measurement.

From there the primary career paths were academia or a testing company, but instead I went into public administration. In 2006 I got a job as a Director of Assessment for a large school district, then went on for several years to do the same job for several other districts. As that was a leadership role I spent a lot of time in leadership meetings and doing managerial work and less time working creatively with data.

I joined the Swedish Pharmacy team in late 2020 and have enjoyed every minute here since then. It's my pleasure to help you make more informed decisions with data.
